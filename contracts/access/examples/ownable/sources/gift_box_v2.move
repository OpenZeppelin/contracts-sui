//! Gift box example secured by `OwnerCap` from `openzeppelin_access::ownable`.
//!
//! The `init` function creates the module's owner capability, switches it to the
//! two-step transfer policy, and finalizes ownership so the deployer holds the
//! capability.
//!
//! Under this policy, a prospective owner must:
//! 1. Call `ownable::request_ownership` to create and transfer an `OwnershipRequestCap`
//!    to the current owner
//! 2. Then, the current owner completes the handoff by calling `ownable::transfer_requested_ownership`
//!
//! This ensures the `OwnerCap` never moves without explicit approval from both parties,
//! preventing accidental loss of access control by transferring to an invalid address.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: While anyone can request ownership of the `OwnerCap`, only the current
//! owner can complete the handoff by calling `ownable::transfer_requested_ownership`.
//! The current owner can reject ownership requests by calling `ownable::reject_ownership_request`.
