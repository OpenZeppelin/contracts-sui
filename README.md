**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Move for [Sui](https://sui.io/), a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain.

## Security

This project is maintained by OpenZeppelin with the goal of providing a secure and reliable library of smart contract components
for the Sui ecosystem. We address security through risk management in various areas such as engineering and open source best
practices, scoping and API design, multi-layered review processes, and incident response preparedness.

Refer to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

Smart contracts are an evolving technology and carry a high level of technical risk and uncertainty. Although OpenZeppelin is well known for its security audits, using OpenZeppelin Contracts for Sui is not a substitute for a security audit.
