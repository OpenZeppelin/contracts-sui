# OpenZeppelin Contracts for Sui

**OpenZeppelin Contracts for Sui** is a collection of secure smart contract
libraries written in Move for the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io/). Our goal
is to bring Web3 standards under the OpenZeppelin quality by providing a set of
high-quality, battle-tested contracts that can be used to build decentralized
applications on the Sui network.

## Usage

Sui smart contracts are written in Move leveraging the Sui Move framework.

### Install Sui:

Follow the installation guide in the [Sui documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).

**Required version**: Sui CLI [1.58.3](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.58.3).

## Docs

Documentation is available inline in the source code. You can generate the
documentation locally using:

```bash
# Generate and view documentation for a specific package
sui move build --doc --path <module>
```

## Notes

We strive to maintain consistency with other OpenZeppelin libraries as much as
possible, following the same conventions and patterns. However, this Sui library
does not have a 1-to-1 mapping with other OpenZeppelin contracts. Due to
differences in the Sui architecture and Move language capabilities, certain
features and implementations may differ from their counterparts in other
ecosystems.

## Security

> [!Warning]
> This library has not been audited yet. Use at your own risk.

For security concerns, please refer to our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

Smart contracts are an evolving technology and carry a high level of technical
risk and uncertainty. Although OpenZeppelin is well known for its security
audits, using OpenZeppelin Contracts for Sui is not a substitute for a security
audit.
